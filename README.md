# bark-it-fluent-theme
An actual Bark-It theme that's based off my Bark-It Fluent design

## how 2 implemtent!!!!
For this you'll need to get Mega32's Bark-It then do the following if this hasn't already been added as a theme yet or you want to experiment on it on your own (open source perks!!!!)
1. Get images from "`/images/`" and put them in the Bark-It "`/images/`".
2. Put "`normal.html`" into "`/templates/themes/`" this will replace the default theme that's first shown in Bark-It.
3. Run "`app.py`", you need at least Python 3.11 for it according to Mega32.
4. Boom enjoy the epickness!!!!!!!!!!!
